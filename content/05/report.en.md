<!-- Prologue start -->

Financial security was an important issue in the national dialogue. Along with good wages, this also includes having an adequate pension in retirement. People want to know that they can rely on state help in times of hardship. Many participants in the national dialogue were concerned about the gap between rich and poor.

## What is the financial situation of households in Germany?

**Individual prosperity** was an important issue for people who took part in the national dialogue. They mainly linked it to earning a steady income that provided them with **financial security**. They expect to be paid fairly for their work. Most people supported the minimum wage. A few people would like the introduction of an unconditional basic income. Only one or two explicitly stated that material prosperity was of less importance.

The **net household income** indicator measures **a household's disposable income**, adjusted for inflation available to a median household[^1] in prices in Germany from 2010.

Net income describes what a household has left after the payment of taxes and social insurance contributions and the receipt of social transfers. It determines the spending for consumption of many families and single people and the amount they can save for their retirement.

**Since reunification** real household income in Germany has **increased** by almost 9.5 per cent, from around 18,100 euros to 19,800 euros. This increase is largely a result of a **catching-up process in the states of eastern Germany**, where net household income has increased by more than 15 per cent from around 14,860 euros to 17,050 euros.

In longitudinal studies such as the [Socio-Economic Panel](http://www.diw.de/en/diw_02.c.299726.en/soep_overview.html) a representative sample of people[^2] are asked about their **household income**.

**Every person living in the household** provides information about their **income**.

The 100 dots are sorted from the lowest to the highest net household income. Each dot represents one per cent of the German population and shows the level of their household income.

As a household's needs do not grow in proportion to the number of people who live in it, the net income of each household is weighted in line with its size and composition, so that it is possible to compare the income of different households. This is based on the [modified OECD equivalence scale](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Equivalised_disposable_income).

In order to compare your own household income with the rest of the population, you need to enter your annual household income and the number of adults and children living in your household. The resulting equivalised net income makes the income of your household comparable to that of a single household.

One of the key aims of the federal government is to ensure that people in Germany have an adequate disposable income and can enjoy a high material standard of living. The first priority is to prevent unemployment and facilitate participation in working life through good work and fair wages. 

Increased productivity, more investment in education, research, infrastructure and social integration and a stable structure of collectively bargained wages all provide the basis for higher employment and incomes. With its labour and welfare policies, the federal government is therefore also seeking to strengthen the social partnership and collective pay agreements.

The federal government has also kept tax levels stable and countered bracket creep through "cold progression".

## Income distribution in Germany

With regard to the distribution of income and wealth in Germany, participants in the national dialogue often criticised the "gap between rich and poor". The discussions showed that people in Germany are very sensitive to this issue. Participants in the national dialogue specifically discussed tax rates, the need for a simpler tax declaration that everyone can understand and measures to prevent tax avoidance and evasion.

<!-- Quote text='In my opinion, it’s important to decrease the gap between rich and poor if the general level of wellbeing in society is to be increased.' source='from an online response submitted on 6 August 2015' -->

The **Gini coefficient of household income** is an established, internationally comparable way of measuring **income distribution**. It is measured on a scale of zero to one. The higher the value, the greater the income inequality. A value of zero indicates that all citizens have an identical income. A value of one indicates that one person has all the disposable income.

The **effectiveness of redistributive policies** is measured by comparing the Gini coefficients **before and after taxes and transfers**.

Inequalities in household net income in Germany remained relatively steady during the 1990s. However, between 2000 and 2005 the Gini coefficient increased from 0.26 to 0.29. **Over the last ten years, income distribution has remained largely stable**.

It is important to note that the Gini coefficient of household income after taxes and transfers (0.29 in 2014) is well below the Gini-coefficient of market income (0.49 in 2014). This shows that the **German tax and social security system achieves a significant reduction in inequality**. It particularly helps low-earners and families and leads to greater income equality.

<!-- ColumnContainer end -->

The [**international comparison of Gini coefficients**](http:dx.doi.org/10.1787/459aa7f1-en) for household income places **Germany** **13th out of 35 OECD countries**. Countries such as Iceland, Slovenia and Slowakia have some of the lowest levels of inequality (about 0.25). Disposable income in the United States of America (0.39), Turkey (0.4), Mexico (0.46) and Costa Rica (0.49) is distributed much less equally than in Germany. Among the major industrial and emerging economies (G20), Germany has the lowest level of inequality for net household incomes.

The **German tax system** has to ensure adequate revenues to finance the public sector and investments in education, research and infrastructure. At the same time, all population groups will only be successfully integrated into the labour market if the tax and welfare systems provide people with incentives to work.

According to the OECD, **the tax ratio**, i.e. the taxes and contributions collected compared to GDP, stood at **36.9 per cent in Germany** in 2015. In the **international comparison**, Germany's tax and contribution ratio is mid-range. On the one hand, individuals and businesses are not financially overburdened. On the other, the level of tax and contributions provide an appropriate level of public services and an effective social welfare system for a highly developed industrial nation.

The German Federal Government is providing targeted support to low-income groups through the introduction of a minimum wage, as well as legislation that focuses labour leasing (temp and subcontracted labour) on its core function and prevents abuse in the systems used for contracting labour. Furthermore, the government provides assistance with skill acquisition through education and further training.

## Distribution of Wealth

An individual's material prosperity is not only determined by their monthly income from employment or business activity but also by their **wealth**. Participants in the national dialogue were very concerned about the fair distribution of wealth. They clearly believe that adequate holdings of assets provide security when needed and make it possible to make long-term plans and reach personal goals. Wealth is the best provision for retirement.

<!-- Quote text='The more just and fair a society is, the most satisfied and stable it will be.' source='from the national dialogue event of the Lebenshilfe in Wetzlar on 18 June 2015' -->

The indicator **wealth distribution** describes the distribution of wealth in Germany using the **Gini coefficient** based on a scale of zero to one, from equal to unequal. The assets analysed include monetary assets, real estate holdings, stocks and other investments – all minus personal debt.

Between 2002 and 2012 the Gini coefficient for **wealth distribution remained relatively stable** at around 0.8, so wealth in Germany is less equally distributed than income. The 10 per cent of wealthiest households hold more than 50 per cent of total net wealth, with about one quarter of total net wealth in the hands of the top 1 per cent of households.

```chart

{

}
```

In the **international comparison** Germany has relatively high wealth inequality. In 2010 the Gini coefficient in Germany was 0.78 (the same as Austria), whereas wealth in other countries such as France (0.68) and Italy (0.61) was more evenly distributed.

However, many country-specific differences have to be taken into account in the international comparison of wealth inequality. The relatively high Gini coefficient for Germany can be partly explained by the fact that entitlements to a public pension are not counted as assets in the calculation. The international comparison also shows that a large number of people in Germany rent rather than own their homes.

The federal government is particularly keen to ensure that all income, including investment income, is taxed fairly. It is therefore important to have an efficient tax collection system. The federal government also opposes tax havens, tax avoidance and tax evasion at international level. The reform of inheritance tax also ensures the constitutional taxation of wealth that has been inherited or gifted.

## People who earn less than 60 per cent of median income

In the national dialogue, many people were **concerned about poverty**, and particularly poverty among children and young people. In the lively debate about poverty, most participants knew that the welfare state protects people against the risk of poverty. However, some of them pointed to existing gaps and wanted to see improvements.

<!-- Quote text='We are a rich country and yet some children still have to go to bed hungry here.' source='from the national dialogue event of ver.di in Cologne on 19 June 2015' -->

**Poverty has many causes**: lack of education, the loss of individual or family income. It can also be a consequence of unforeseen circumstances, such as long periods of severe illness or losing one's job.

The **risk-of-poverty rate** measures the proportion of the population that lives in relative income poverty. People are considered to be at risk of poverty if they have to live on less than 60 per cent of median net household income. It is **important to distinguish between relative and absolute poverty**. The social security safety net generally means there is no absolute poverty in Germany.

<!-- ColumnRight start -->

**After reunification** the risk-of-poverty rate increased from 11 per cent to 15 per cent. In 2014 the risk of poverty rate was 15.8 per cent.

Poverty threatens **certain at-risk groups**: Women are at greater risk of poverty than men. Single parents and large families also have an increased risk of being poor. People who are immigrants are at greater risk of poverty than people from Germany.

The **risk of poverty** affects **different age groups in different ways** but young people are most affected. Children and teenagers are always affected by the poverty of their parents. The high risk of poverty among young adults is, however, often temporary. It falls dramatically after they have finished their education. This shows that education provides the basis for a sound future.

Compared to younger age groups, **senior citizens** have a **relatively low risk of poverty** in Germany. In other words, old-age poverty is currently not a widespread problem in Germany. This situation could change in future, however. The long-term unemployed, those with reduced earning capacity, the (single) self-employed and single parents tend to have an increased risk of poverty.

<!-- ColumnRight end -->

<!-- ColumnContainer end -->

The **government's redistribution mechanisms** have also had an impact on the risk of poverty rate. Considering market income alone, i.e. ignoring tax and transfers, then the poverty risk rate in 2014 was 35.2 per cent. After deducting taxes and adding transfer payments, the rate was 15.8 per cent.

Fighting poverty is a key issue for the federal government. Families benefit here from the new parental allowance (*Elterngeld Plus*) and the children’s allowance, as well as from the recent increase in the child tax credit. Furthermore, the government housing benefit was significantly increased for low-income households. Investment in education and an effective labour market policy are some of the best ways of preventing poverty in the long run.

## Secure in old age

People want to be financially secure in old age. They also expect the pension system to be affordable and that future generations should not have to worry about having a secure pension. This was the unanimous tone of the national dialogue.

<!-- Quote text='Government policies should take the demographic transformation into account; otherwise future generations will have big problems.' source='from the national dialogue event at the Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen in Schwerte on 9 September 2015' -->

The **personal pension provision** should be built on **more than one pillars** in order to ensure financial security in old age. The **statutory pension** continues to be the **main pillar of pension provision** for the majority of the working population. It can be supplemented by **voluntary company and private pensions**. These are important in light of demographic change.

The **increase in life expectancy** means that people are drawing pensions for many more years. And, large numbers of "baby boomers", the generation born between 1955 and 1964, are approaching retirement age. This presents a huge challenge to the statutory pension insurance.

The **population's age structure** is shown by the **old-age dependency ratio**. It describes how many older people (67 and above) there are per 100 people of working age (20 to 66). Since 2010, the ratio has been around 30, so 100 people of working age to 30 pensioners. By 2040, this will have increased to 50 pensioners for every 100 people of working age.

For the statutory pension insurance, the ratio of contributors and recipients is deteriorating and in future fewer workers will be required to fund more pensioners.

The vast majority of retired people in Germany are currently able to do without government support. Some 526,000 elderly individuals received basic income support from the government in December 2016.

Various scientific studies show that future generations of retirees face an increasing risk of old-age poverty. There are various reasons why this risk is increasing. For one thing, employment histories and household structures have been changing and will continue to change.

In future, it will be necessary to better use the full potential of the labour force, because in economic terms it is not the number of people of working age that matters but whether these people are actually working with maximum productivity. The long-term viability of all the pillars of pension provision can be ensured if people are in a position to provide for their retirement through good employment opportunities (for everyone and every age group up to pension age) and adequate wage levels. In doing this, it is important to ensure that they are not burdened by high levels of taxes and contributions.

<!-- GovernmentMeasures start -->

For the federal government the so-called "three-pillar model" comprising statutory, company and private pension plans provides the model for a responsible pension policy. In 2016, pensioners saw the biggest increase in their pensions for more than 20 years. With its demographic strategy, the federal government is focused on creating policies to address demographic change.

[^1]: The median describes households in the mid-range of income distribution. 50 per cent of households in Germany have a lower disposable income than this household and 50% have a higher disposable income.
[^2]: The statistics distinguish between the **general population** and the **sample**. When applied to Germany's resident population the general population includes everyone who lives in Germany on a particular reporting date. A sample is when certain people are selected from the general population, for example for the purposes of the survey. This selection process is random, so it is not determined in advance who will take part in the survey. A basic law of statistics states that conclusions about the general population can be drawn based on an adequately large sample.
